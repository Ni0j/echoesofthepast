      <!-- <div class="subtitle">关于</div> -->
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;在这组作品中，将纽约市的井盖重新想象为福禄--中国文化中历史上用来封印、保护和抵御邪恶力量的神秘护身符。这些古老的符号曾为人们提供精神上的保护，而今天，这些铁井盖在我们的街道上找到了现代的对应物。它们就像盾牌一样，将城市表面生机勃勃的生活与地下隐藏的复杂系统隔开。这些现代封印保护着地下基础设施，确保安全，防止灾难，就像福禄保护古代人民一样。本网站将实用的护身符与中国古代典籍中的故事配对，说明它们的象征力量。书中提供了中文原文和英文译文，将符箓的古代用途和现代形式联系起来。这样一来，井盖就不仅仅是城市景观的一部分，它们还象征着不为人知的守护，隐藏在人们的视线之中。此外，书中收录的符箓都是根据历史上现存的《富禄七十二家封宅符》改编而成，其功能被重新诠释为现代用途。这些故事不仅能提供保护，还能让人深入了解印章的文化意义以及它们在历史上的力量。

      <div class="subtitle">“Li the Magistrate”
        <br>from What the Master Would Not Discuss 
        <br>by Yuan Mei (Qing Dynasty)</div>
      Magistrate Li of Guangxi was an extremely wealthy man. He kept seven concubines, and his home was filled with treasures stacked like mountains. At the age of twenty-seven, Li passed away due to illness. Among his servants was an old man who had always been loyal and diligent. Saddened by the premature death of his master, the old servant, together with the seven concubines, set up a memorial service and offered sacrifices. Suddenly, a Taoist priest appeared, holding a ledger and asking for donations.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant scolded him, saying, “Our master has died young, and we have no time to give to you.” The Taoist smiled and replied, “Do you wish for your master to return to life? I can perform a ritual to bring him back.” The old servant was astonished and hurriedly informed the concubines. They were all amazed and skeptical. They rushed outside to bow to the priest, but by then, the Taoist had disappeared. The old servant and the concubines regretted their earlier dismissive attitude toward the divine, blaming themselves for driving him away.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, while the old servant was walking through the marketplace, he encountered the Taoist again. The servant, both shocked and overjoyed, forcefully held on to him, begging for forgiveness and mercy. The Taoist said, “It is not that I am unwilling to bring your master back to life, but the laws of the underworld state that for someone to return to the living, a substitute must take their place. I feared that no one in your household would be willing to die in his stead, so I left.” The old servant replied, “Allow me to return home and discuss this.”
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant brought the Taoist back to the house and relayed the priest’s words to the concubines. At first, the concubines were delighted to hear that the Taoist could bring back their master, but upon learning that someone must die in exchange, they all became angry. They stared at each other, remaining silent. The old servant, however, stood up and declared, “You young ladies are in the prime of your youth; it would be a pity for you to die. As for this old servant, I am nearing the end of my days, so what does it matter?” He went out to the Taoist and asked, “Can I, an old servant, be the substitute?” The Taoist replied, “As long as you have no regrets or fear, it is possible.” The servant responded, “I am willing.” The Taoist said, “Because of your sincerity, you may go out and say goodbye to your relatives and friends. Once I begin the ritual, it will be completed in three days, and the results will be evident within seven.”
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant treated the Taoist with great respect, taking him into the house and performing morning and evening rituals. He visited various friends and relatives, tearfully bidding them farewell. Some laughed, some respected him, some pitied him, while others mocked him for believing in such a thing. The servant also visited the temple of the Sage Emperor, where he had often prayed. Kneeling before the altar, he prayed, “I am offering my life in place of my master’s. Please, Sage Emperor, assist the Taoist in returning my master’s soul.” Before he could finish speaking, a barefoot monk appeared in front of the altar and sternly said, “Your face is covered in demonic energy, and a great disaster is about to befall you! I will save you, but be careful not to reveal this to anyone.” The monk handed him a paper package, saying, “Open this when the time comes.” After speaking, the monk disappeared. The old servant secretly opened the package and found five claws and a length of rope. He placed them in his pocket.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the third day arrived, and the Taoist ordered the servant’s bed to be moved so it faced the master’s coffin. He locked the door with iron chains and left a hole through which food could be passed. The Taoist built an altar nearby, along with the concubines, and began chanting incantations. After some time, nothing unusual happened. The old servant grew suspicious.

        <blockquote id="quote">
          As soon as he began to doubt, he heard a rustling sound beneath the bed.
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two black figures leaped out from the ground. They had green eyes and deep-set sockets, short fur covering their entire bodies, and stood about two feet tall, with heads as large as cartwheels. Their glaring eyes fixated on the servant as they circled the coffin, biting at its seams. The seam cracked open, and the sound of coughing emerged—just like the master’s. The two ghosts opened the coffin lid and helped the master out, though he appeared weak and sickly. The ghosts rubbed his belly, and his voice became audible. But as the old servant watched, he noticed that the figure resembled his master, but the voice was that of the Taoist. Suddenly, the servant recalled the words of the Sage Emperor and thought, “Could it be that his warning was true?” In haste, he grabbed the claws from his pocket. They flew out and transformed into a golden dragon, several feet long, which grabbed the old servant and tied him to a beam in the room. The servant, now groggy, looked down and saw the two ghosts helping the master out of the coffin and laying him on the servant’s bed, but no one entered his body. The master cried out loudly, “The ritual has failed!” The two ghosts, furious, searched the room but could not find him. Enraged, the master tore apart the servant’s bedding in frustration. One of the ghosts looked up and saw the servant tied to the beam, rejoicing and attempting to grab him along with the master. But before they could reach him, a loud thunderclap sounded, and they were both struck down. The coffin resealed itself, and the ghosts vanished.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concubines, hearing the thunder, rushed to open the door. The old servant explained everything he had witnessed. Together, they hurried to check on the Taoist, only to find that he had been struck dead by lightning on the altar. His corpse bore the smell of sulfur, and there, written in large characters, were the words: “This fraudulent Taoist sought to change forms through sorcery, driven by greed for wealth and lust. The laws of Heaven have sentenced him to execution.”
