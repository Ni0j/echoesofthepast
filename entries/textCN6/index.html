      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;章丘查牙山，有石窟如井，深数尺许。北壁有洞门，伏而引领望见之。 会近村数辈，九日登临，饮共处，共谋人探之。三人受灯，缒而下。
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;洞高敞与夏屋等；入数武，稍狭，即忽见底。底际一窦，蛇行可入。 烛之，漆漆然暗深不测。两人馁而却退；一人夺火而嗤之，锐身塞而进。 幸隘处仅厚于堵，即又顿高顿阔，乃立，乃行。顶上石参差危耸、将坠不 坠。两壁嶙嶙峋峋然，类寺庙山塑，都成鸟兽人鬼形：鸟若飞，兽若 走，人若坐若立，鬼罔两示现忿怒；奇奇怪怪，类多丑少妍。心凛然作怖 畏。喜径夷，无少陂。逡巡几百步，西壁开石室，门左一怪石鬼， 面人而立，目努，口箕张，齿舌狞恶；左手作拳，触腰际；右手叉五指，欲 扑人。心大恐，毛森森似立。遥望门中有爇灰，知有人曾至者，胆乃稍壮， 强入之。见地上列碗盏，泥垢其中；然皆近今物，非古窑也。傍置锡壶 四，心利之，解带缚项系腰间。即又旁瞩，一尸卧西隅，两肱及股四布以横。骇极。渐审之，足蹑锐履，梅花刻底犹存，知是少妇。 人不知何里，毙不知何年。衣色黯败，莫辨青红；发蓬蓬似筐许，乱丝粘着髑髅上；目、鼻孔各二；瓠犀两行，白巉巉，意是口也。存想首颠当有金珠饰，以火近脑，似有口气嘘灯，灯摇摇无定，焰纁黄，衣动掀掀。复大惧，手摇颤，灯顿灭。忆路急奔，不敢手索壁，恐触鬼者物也。头触石，仆，即复起；冷湿浸颔颊，知是血，不觉痛，抑不敢呻；坌息奔至窦，方将伏，似有人捉发住，晕然遂绝。
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;众坐井上俟久，疑之，又缒二人下。探身入窦，见发罥石上，血淫淫已僵。二人失色，不敢入，坐愁叹。俄井上又使二人下；中有勇者，始健进， 曳之以出。置山上，半日方醒，言之缕缕，所恨未穷其底极；穷之，必更有佳境。后章令闻之，以丸泥封窦，不可复入矣。
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;康熙二十六、七年间，养母峪之南石崖崩，现洞口；望之，钟乳林林如密笋。然深险，无人敢入。忽有道士至，自称钟离弟子，言：“师遣先至，粪除洞府。”居人供以膏火，道士携之而下，坠石笋上，贯腹 而死。报令，令封其洞。其中必有奇境，惜道士尸解，无回音耳。

      <div class="subtitle">“Li the Magistrate”
        <br>from What the Master Would Not Discuss 
        <br>by Yuan Mei (Qing Dynasty)</div>
      Magistrate Li of Guangxi was an extremely wealthy man. He kept seven concubines, and his home was filled with treasures stacked like mountains. At the age of twenty-seven, Li passed away due to illness. Among his servants was an old man who had always been loyal and diligent. Saddened by the premature death of his master, the old servant, together with the seven concubines, set up a memorial service and offered sacrifices. Suddenly, a Taoist priest appeared, holding a ledger and asking for donations.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant scolded him, saying, “Our master has died young, and we have no time to give to you.” The Taoist smiled and replied, “Do you wish for your master to return to life? I can perform a ritual to bring him back.” The old servant was astonished and hurriedly informed the concubines. They were all amazed and skeptical. They rushed outside to bow to the priest, but by then, the Taoist had disappeared. The old servant and the concubines regretted their earlier dismissive attitude toward the divine, blaming themselves for driving him away.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, while the old servant was walking through the marketplace, he encountered the Taoist again. The servant, both shocked and overjoyed, forcefully held on to him, begging for forgiveness and mercy. The Taoist said, “It is not that I am unwilling to bring your master back to life, but the laws of the underworld state that for someone to return to the living, a substitute must take their place. I feared that no one in your household would be willing to die in his stead, so I left.” The old servant replied, “Allow me to return home and discuss this.”
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant brought the Taoist back to the house and relayed the priest’s words to the concubines. At first, the concubines were delighted to hear that the Taoist could bring back their master, but upon learning that someone must die in exchange, they all became angry. They stared at each other, remaining silent. The old servant, however, stood up and declared, “You young ladies are in the prime of your youth; it would be a pity for you to die. As for this old servant, I am nearing the end of my days, so what does it matter?” He went out to the Taoist and asked, “Can I, an old servant, be the substitute?” The Taoist replied, “As long as you have no regrets or fear, it is possible.” The servant responded, “I am willing.” The Taoist said, “Because of your sincerity, you may go out and say goodbye to your relatives and friends. Once I begin the ritual, it will be completed in three days, and the results will be evident within seven.”
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant treated the Taoist with great respect, taking him into the house and performing morning and evening rituals. He visited various friends and relatives, tearfully bidding them farewell. Some laughed, some respected him, some pitied him, while others mocked him for believing in such a thing. The servant also visited the temple of the Sage Emperor, where he had often prayed. Kneeling before the altar, he prayed, “I am offering my life in place of my master’s. Please, Sage Emperor, assist the Taoist in returning my master’s soul.” Before he could finish speaking, a barefoot monk appeared in front of the altar and sternly said, “Your face is covered in demonic energy, and a great disaster is about to befall you! I will save you, but be careful not to reveal this to anyone.” The monk handed him a paper package, saying, “Open this when the time comes.” After speaking, the monk disappeared. The old servant secretly opened the package and found five claws and a length of rope. He placed them in his pocket.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the third day arrived, and the Taoist ordered the servant’s bed to be moved so it faced the master’s coffin. He locked the door with iron chains and left a hole through which food could be passed. The Taoist built an altar nearby, along with the concubines, and began chanting incantations. After some time, nothing unusual happened. The old servant grew suspicious.

          As soon as he began to doubt, he heard a rustling sound beneath the bed.
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two black figures leaped out from the ground. They had green eyes and deep-set sockets, short fur covering their entire bodies, and stood about two feet tall, with heads as large as cartwheels. Their glaring eyes fixated on the servant as they circled the coffin, biting at its seams. The seam cracked open, and the sound of coughing emerged—just like the master’s. The two ghosts opened the coffin lid and helped the master out, though he appeared weak and sickly. The ghosts rubbed his belly, and his voice became audible. But as the old servant watched, he noticed that the figure resembled his master, but the voice was that of the Taoist. Suddenly, the servant recalled the words of the Sage Emperor and thought, “Could it be that his warning was true?” In haste, he grabbed the claws from his pocket. They flew out and transformed into a golden dragon, several feet long, which grabbed the old servant and tied him to a beam in the room. The servant, now groggy, looked down and saw the two ghosts helping the master out of the coffin and laying him on the servant’s bed, but no one entered his body. The master cried out loudly, “The ritual has failed!” The two ghosts, furious, searched the room but could not find him. Enraged, the master tore apart the servant’s bedding in frustration. One of the ghosts looked up and saw the servant tied to the beam, rejoicing and attempting to grab him along with the master. But before they could reach him, a loud thunderclap sounded, and they were both struck down. The coffin resealed itself, and the ghosts vanished.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concubines, hearing the thunder, rushed to open the door. The old servant explained everything he had witnessed. Together, they hurried to check on the Taoist, only to find that he had been struck dead by lightning on the altar. His corpse bore the smell of sulfur, and there, written in large characters, were the words: “This fraudulent Taoist sought to change forms through sorcery, driven by greed for wealth and lust. The laws of Heaven have sentenced him to execution.”
