      <div class="subtitle">“The Hall of the Daffodil” 
        <br>from What the Master Would Not Discuss 
        <br>by Yuan Mei (Qing Dynasty)</div>
        In Hangzhou, students were preparing for an upcoming exam. Many gathered at Minglun Hall to stand as guarantors for candidate who had yet to obtain official student status. This process was known as Bao Jie. A student named Cheng woke up before dawn one day, dressed, and left his house, only to return after walking two or three miles. He shut himself inside a room, muttering as if talking to someone, much to the puzzlement of his family. However, they were too afraid to ask what was happening. Shortly after, Cheng left again and did not return for a long time.
        <br><br>
        One of the candidates for whom Cheng had been acting as a guarantor came to his house to inquire about him, leaving the family astonished. As they were puzzling over Cheng's whereabouts, a barrel-maker returned him home. Cheng's clothes were soaked, his face smeared with blue mud, and he appeared dazed, unable to speak.
        They gave him ginger tea to drink and applied cinnabar on his body. After some time, Cheng was able to speak and explained: “The first time I left the house, I encountered a man dressed in black, who bowed to me. I immediately fell into a trance and followed him. He said, 'Go back home, pack your things, and come with me to visit The Hall of the Daffodil. What do you say?' So I brought him back to my house, tied my keys around my waist, and left with him through the Yongjin Gate, heading to the shores of West Lake.
        <br><br>
        There, on the water's surface, stood a golden palace, shining brightly. Inside were several beautiful women with painted faces, singing and dancing. The man in black gestured to the palace and said, 'This is Water Nymph Hall. Tell me, which is more enjoyable—watching beautiful women here or standing as a guarantor at Minglun Hall?' I answered, 'This place is certainly more fun.' With that, I began walking towards the water.
        <br><br>
        Suddenly, an old man with white hair appeared and shouted, 'This is a demon trying to deceive you! Don't go any further!' I turned and saw that it was my deceased father. The man in black started fighting with my father, who was barely able to fend him off.
        <br><br>
        At that moment, I encountered the barrel-maker. It felt like a warm breeze swept over the water, and the man in black immediately fled. The Water Nymph Hall and my father disappeared as well, and I was finally able to return home.”
        <br><br>
        The family thanked the barrel-maker profusely and asked him how he had saved Cheng. The barrel-maker explained, “Today, I was called to fix a barrel for the Yang family inside Yongjin Gate. While passing by West Lake, I saw an umbrella on the ground and bent down to pick it up to shield myself from the sun. Just as I approached it, I heard noises coming from the water and realized someone was in trouble. I rushed over and found your Mr. Cheng trying to drown himself. It took quite some time to pull him out.”
        <br><br>
        Cheng's wife remarked, “People are living ghosts, and ghosts are the dead. People don't force ghosts to become human, but ghosts like to force people into becoming ghosts. Why is that?” 
        <br><br>
        Suddenly, a voice from the air responded, “I, too, was a scholar in life. The texts say, 'A person of benevolence and righteousness seeks to elevate both themselves and others.' As ghosts, we try to drown others because we ourselves drowned; we encourage others to hang themselves because we hung ourselves. Why should that be any different?” After saying this, the voice burst into laughter and disappeared.
