      <div class="subtitle">“Chaya Cave” 
        <br>from Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio
        <br>by Pu Songling (Qing Dynasty)</div>
        In Zhangqiu's Chaya Mountain, there is a stone cave resembling a well, several feet deep. On the northern wall, there is a door to the cave, visible only by bending down and craning the neck. On the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, a group of villagers from nearby gathered for a climb, drinking together, and discussing sending someone to explore the cave. Three men took lamps and were lowered down by rope.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave was as spacious as a summer house; after a few feet, it narrowed, then suddenly reached the bottom. At the base, there was a small hole, large enough for a person to crawl through. Illuminating it with a candle, it was pitch black, unfathomably deep. Two of the men lost their courage and retreated, but one seized the fire and mocked them, forcing his way forward. Fortunately, the narrow part was just wider than a wall; then it opened up again, becoming higher and wider. He stood up and walked. The stone above his head was jagged and precarious, as if about to fall but never quite did. The walls were rugged and uneven, resembling the sculpted figures in temple mountains, forming the shapes of birds, beasts, humans, and ghosts. The birds seemed to fly, the beasts appeared to run, and the humans either sat or stood, while the ghosts displayed angry and fierce expressions. The strange shapes were mostly grotesque, few were beautiful, instilling fear and awe in the heart. He was relieved the path was flat with no slopes.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several hundred steps, a stone chamber opened on the western wall. At the door stood a grotesque stone figure of a ghost, facing outward, with bulging eyes and a gaping mouth, its teeth and tongue menacing. Its left hand clenched into a fist at its waist, while the right hand stretched out with five fingers as if about to strike. The explorer was filled with terror, his hair standing on end. In the distance, he saw smoldering ashes inside the chamber, realizing someone had been there before, which gave him a little courage to proceed. Inside, he found bowls and cups on the ground, covered in mud; they appeared to be of recent origin, not ancient pottery. Nearby were four tin pots, which he coveted, so he tied them with his belt, securing them to his neck and waist.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking further, he saw a corpse lying in the western corner, with arms and legs sprawled out. Horrified, he gradually examined it more closely. The corpse wore pointed shoes, with the plum-blossom pattern still visible on the soles, indicating it was a young woman. No one knew where she was from or when she had died. Her clothing was faded and colorless, making it impossible to discern if it had been red or green. Her hair was thick and matted, like a bundle, with tangled strands stuck to her skull. Her eyes and nose had two holes each; her teeth were lined up in two rows, shining white, making it clear where her mouth had been. He imagined that the top of her head must have once been adorned with gold and jewels, and when he brought a flame near her head, it seemed as if her breath blew the flame, causing it to flicker unsteadily, with the flame turning yellow and her clothes fluttering. Filled with overwhelming fear, his hand shook, and the light went out.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a panic, he tried to remember the way out, running without touching the walls for fear of encountering ghosts or other objects. He hit his head on a stone, fell, and then got up again. Cold wetness seeped into his cheeks and chin, and he realized it was blood. He felt no pain but dared not cry out. He sprinted to the hole, about to crawl through when he felt as if someone grabbed his hair, and he fainted.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those waiting at the top of the well had waited for a long time and grew suspicious, so they lowered two more people down. Peering into the hole, they saw hair caught on the stone, blood oozing, and the body already stiff. The two were terrified and did not dare to enter, sitting down to sigh in despair. Shortly after, two more men were sent down; among them was a brave man who ventured forward and dragged the unconscious explorer out. They placed him on the mountain, and after half a day, he finally woke up, recounting his experience in great detail. He regretted not reaching the end of the cave, convinced that if he had gone further, there would have been even more wonders.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the local magistrate heard about this and ordered the cave to be sealed with clay, forbidding anyone from entering again.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh year of the Kangxi reign, a rock cliff south of Yangmu Valley collapsed, revealing a cave entrance. Looking into it, one could see stalactites dense like bamboo shoots. However, the cave was so deep and treacherous that no one dared to enter. Suddenly, a Daoist arrived, claiming to be a disciple of Zhongli, saying, “My master sent me ahead to clean the cave dwelling.” The villagers provided him with oil lamps, and the Daoist descended into the cave. He fell onto a stalactite, impaling his abdomen, and died. The local authorities were informed, and the cave was sealed. It is said that the cave holds wondrous sights, but the Daoist's death left its mysteries unrevealed.
