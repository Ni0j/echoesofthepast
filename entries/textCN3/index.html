      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绍兴王生某，食饩有年，村中富家延之为师。因屋宇湫隘，适相距里许有新室求售者，遂买使居，且曰：“家中摒挡未尽，学徒暨馆童辈明晨进馆，先生一夜独眠，能无惧乎？”王自负胆壮，且新室也，何畏之有，乃命童携茗具引至书斋。
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;王周视室内毕，复至门前徙倚。时已夜矣，月色大明，见山下爝火荧荧。趋往视之，光出一白木棺中。王念：“此鬼磷耶？色宜碧。而焰带微赤，得无为金银气乎？忆《智囊》所载：『有胡人数辈凶服舆榇而藁葬城外者，捕人迹之，榇中皆黄白也。』此棺毋乃类是？幸无人，可攫而取也。遂取石块击去其钉，从棺后推卸其盖，则赫然一尸，面青紫而腹膨亨，麻冠草履。越俗：『凡父母在堂而子先亡者，例以此殓。』王愕然退缩，每一缩则尸一跃，再缩而尸蹷然起。王尽力狂奔，尸自后追之。王入户登楼，闭门下键。喘息甫定，疑尸已去，开窗视之。窗启而尸昂首大喜，从外跃入。连叩门，不得入。忽大声悲呼，三呼而诸门洞开，若有启之者，遂登楼。王无奈何，持木棍待之。尸甫上，即击以棍，中其肩，所挂银锭散落于地，尸俯而拾取。王趁其伛偻时，尽力推之，尸滚楼下。旋闻鸡啼，从此寂无声响矣。
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;明日视之，尸跌伤腿骨，横卧于地，遂召众人扛而焚之。王叹曰：“我以贪故，招尸上楼；尸以贪故，被火烧毁。鬼尚不可贪，而况于人乎！”

      <div class="subtitle">“Li the Magistrate”
        <br>from What the Master Would Not Discuss 
        <br>by Yuan Mei (Qing Dynasty)</div>
      Magistrate Li of Guangxi was an extremely wealthy man. He kept seven concubines, and his home was filled with treasures stacked like mountains. At the age of twenty-seven, Li passed away due to illness. Among his servants was an old man who had always been loyal and diligent. Saddened by the premature death of his master, the old servant, together with the seven concubines, set up a memorial service and offered sacrifices. Suddenly, a Taoist priest appeared, holding a ledger and asking for donations.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant scolded him, saying, “Our master has died young, and we have no time to give to you.” The Taoist smiled and replied, “Do you wish for your master to return to life? I can perform a ritual to bring him back.” The old servant was astonished and hurriedly informed the concubines. They were all amazed and skeptical. They rushed outside to bow to the priest, but by then, the Taoist had disappeared. The old servant and the concubines regretted their earlier dismissive attitude toward the divine, blaming themselves for driving him away.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, while the old servant was walking through the marketplace, he encountered the Taoist again. The servant, both shocked and overjoyed, forcefully held on to him, begging for forgiveness and mercy. The Taoist said, “It is not that I am unwilling to bring your master back to life, but the laws of the underworld state that for someone to return to the living, a substitute must take their place. I feared that no one in your household would be willing to die in his stead, so I left.” The old servant replied, “Allow me to return home and discuss this.”
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant brought the Taoist back to the house and relayed the priest’s words to the concubines. At first, the concubines were delighted to hear that the Taoist could bring back their master, but upon learning that someone must die in exchange, they all became angry. They stared at each other, remaining silent. The old servant, however, stood up and declared, “You young ladies are in the prime of your youth; it would be a pity for you to die. As for this old servant, I am nearing the end of my days, so what does it matter?” He went out to the Taoist and asked, “Can I, an old servant, be the substitute?” The Taoist replied, “As long as you have no regrets or fear, it is possible.” The servant responded, “I am willing.” The Taoist said, “Because of your sincerity, you may go out and say goodbye to your relatives and friends. Once I begin the ritual, it will be completed in three days, and the results will be evident within seven.”
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old servant treated the Taoist with great respect, taking him into the house and performing morning and evening rituals. He visited various friends and relatives, tearfully bidding them farewell. Some laughed, some respected him, some pitied him, while others mocked him for believing in such a thing. The servant also visited the temple of the Sage Emperor, where he had often prayed. Kneeling before the altar, he prayed, “I am offering my life in place of my master’s. Please, Sage Emperor, assist the Taoist in returning my master’s soul.” Before he could finish speaking, a barefoot monk appeared in front of the altar and sternly said, “Your face is covered in demonic energy, and a great disaster is about to befall you! I will save you, but be careful not to reveal this to anyone.” The monk handed him a paper package, saying, “Open this when the time comes.” After speaking, the monk disappeared. The old servant secretly opened the package and found five claws and a length of rope. He placed them in his pocket.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the third day arrived, and the Taoist ordered the servant’s bed to be moved so it faced the master’s coffin. He locked the door with iron chains and left a hole through which food could be passed. The Taoist built an altar nearby, along with the concubines, and began chanting incantations. After some time, nothing unusual happened. The old servant grew suspicious.

          As soon as he began to doubt, he heard a rustling sound beneath the bed.

      </div>
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two black figures leaped out from the ground. They had green eyes and deep-set sockets, short fur covering their entire bodies, and stood about two feet tall, with heads as large as cartwheels. Their glaring eyes fixated on the servant as they circled the coffin, biting at its seams. The seam cracked open, and the sound of coughing emerged—just like the master’s. The two ghosts opened the coffin lid and helped the master out, though he appeared weak and sickly. The ghosts rubbed his belly, and his voice became audible. But as the old servant watched, he noticed that the figure resembled his master, but the voice was that of the Taoist. Suddenly, the servant recalled the words of the Sage Emperor and thought, “Could it be that his warning was true?” In haste, he grabbed the claws from his pocket. They flew out and transformed into a golden dragon, several feet long, which grabbed the old servant and tied him to a beam in the room. The servant, now groggy, looked down and saw the two ghosts helping the master out of the coffin and laying him on the servant’s bed, but no one entered his body. The master cried out loudly, “The ritual has failed!” The two ghosts, furious, searched the room but could not find him. Enraged, the master tore apart the servant’s bedding in frustration. One of the ghosts looked up and saw the servant tied to the beam, rejoicing and attempting to grab him along with the master. But before they could reach him, a loud thunderclap sounded, and they were both struck down. The coffin resealed itself, and the ghosts vanished.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concubines, hearing the thunder, rushed to open the door. The old servant explained everything he had witnessed. Together, they hurried to check on the Taoist, only to find that he had been struck dead by lightning on the altar. His corpse bore the smell of sulfur, and there, written in large characters, were the words: “This fraudulent Taoist sought to change forms through sorcery, driven by greed for wealth and lust. The laws of Heaven have sentenced him to execution.”
