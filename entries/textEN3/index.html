      <div class="subtitle">“Zombies Suffer from Greed for Money” 
        <br>from What the Master Would Not Discuss 
        <br>by Yuan Mei (Qing Dynasty)</div>
        In Shaoxing, there was a man named Wang who had been receiving the government stipend for years and was invited by a wealthy family in the village to serve as a tutor. Since the current house was cramped, he found that about one li (half a kilometer) away, there was a new house for sale. He bought it to reside in and remarked, “The arrangements at home are not yet completed. The students and servants will come to the school early tomorrow morning. Will the teacher be unafraid to sleep alone here for the night?” Wang, confident in his courage, and considering that it was a new house, thought, “What is there to fear?” So he had a servant bring tea and led him to the study.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After surveying the room, Wang went to the door and leaned outside. By then, it was already night-time, and the moon was bright. He saw faint torchlights flickering in the distance at the foot of the mountain. Curious, he hurried over to take a look and saw that the light was coming from inside a white wooden coffin. Wang thought, “Is this ghost fire? But its color should be greenish. The flame has a faint red hue—could it be the glow of gold and silver? I recall the story from The Book of Wisdom, which tells of several nomads dressed in mourning who carried a coffin to bury outside the city, and someone tracked them, finding the coffin filled with gold and silver. Could this be similar? Luckily, no one is around, so I could take it for myself.”
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed a stone and struck the nails out of the coffin. Pushing open the lid from the back, he was startled to see a corpse inside. Its face was blue and purple, and its stomach was swollen. It wore a hemp hat and straw shoes. In Yue customs, when a child dies before their parents, they are buried in such attire. Wang, shocked, backed away. Each step he took back, the corpse leaped closer. After retreating twice, the corpse suddenly stood up. Wang ran for his life, but the corpse chased him.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang rushed into the house and climbed to the second floor, locking the door behind him. Just as he caught his breath and thought the corpse had left, he opened the window to check. As soon as the window opened, the corpse raised its head, overjoyed, and jumped in from outside. It banged on the door but couldn't get in. Suddenly, it let out loud, mournful cries. After three cries, all the doors in the house flew open, as if someone had unlocked them. The corpse ascended the stairs.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left with no choice, Wang grabbed a wooden stick to defend himself. As soon as the corpse reached the top, he struck it on the shoulder, causing several silver ingots to fall to the ground. The corpse bent over to pick them up. Seizing the opportunity, Wang used all his strength to push the corpse, sending it tumbling down the stairs. Shortly after, the rooster crowed, and all was silent. 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Wang found the corpse with a broken leg, lying on the ground. He summoned others to carry it away and burn it. Reflecting on the incident, Wang sighed, “Because of my greed, I invited the corpse upstairs. And because of its greed, the corpse was burned to ashes. If even ghosts shouldn't be greedy, how much more so for humans!”
