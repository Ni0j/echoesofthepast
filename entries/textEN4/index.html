      <div class="subtitle">“Li Ji Slays the Giant Serpent” 
        <br>from In Search of the Supernatural
        <br>by Gan Bao (Jin-dynasty)</div>
        In the eastern Yue region of Fujian, there was Mount Yong, towering dozens of miles high. In the northwest swamp beneath the mountain, there lived a large snake, seven to eight zhang (about 70-80 feet) long, and over ten arm spans in girth. The local people lived in constant fear of it. Many officials, including the magistrates of Dongye and other nearby cities, had died mysteriously. To avoid calamity, they would offer sacrifices of cattle and sheep to the snake. At times, the snake would communicate with people in dreams or through sorcerers, demanding to consume young girls around the age of twelve or thirteen. The magistrates, officials, and others were all deeply troubled, but they were unable to quell the serpent's malevolent influence.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy the snake's demand, they began raising daughters from households with criminal charges or purchased young slave girls for sacrifice. Every year in August, a girl would be offered at the entrance of the snake's lair, where the snake would emerge to devour her. This had gone on for years, and nine girls had already been sacrificed.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they once again sought a girl to sacrifice but had not yet found one. In Jiangle County, there was a man named Li Dan who had six daughters and no sons. His youngest daughter, named Ji, volunteered to be sacrificed. However, her parents refused. Ji said, “Father and Mother, you were not blessed with a son, and though you have six daughters, it's as if you had none. I cannot repay your kindness or support you in old age. My life is of no benefit. Instead of lingering here, wouldn't it be better if I died early? By selling me, you could at least get some money to support yourselves. Wouldn't that be good?”
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though her parents loved her dearly, they still refused to let her go. Ji, however, secretly made her decision and could not be stopped.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then asked for a good sword and 
        a snake-hunting dog. When August came, 
        she went to the temple to sit and wait, with the sword in her hand and the dog by her side. Before the sacrifice, she prepared several stones of rice cakes, soaked in honey and flour, and placed them at the entrance of the snake's lair. When the snake emerged, its head was as large as a grain storage bin, and its eyes were like two-foot-wide mirrors. Smelling the fragrance of the rice cakes, it devoured them first.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing the opportunity, Ji released the dog to attack. The dog bit the snake viciously, while Ji struck it from behind with her sword, inflicting several wounds. The snake, in great pain, leaped out of 
        its lair, and after a struggle, died in the courtyard. 
        Ji entered the lair and found the skulls of the nine sacrificed girls, which she removed. She lamented, “You were weak and perished at the hands of this snake. How pitiful!” With that, she calmly returned home.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the King of Yue heard of her bravery, he made Ji his queen and appointed her father 
        as magistrate of Jiangle. Her mother and sisters were also rewarded. From that time forward, Dongye was free of monsters and evil spirits. The story remains 
        a local legend to this day.
