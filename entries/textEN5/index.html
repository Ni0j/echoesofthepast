      <div class="subtitle">“Biting Ghost” 
        <br>from Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio
        <br>by Pu Songling (Qing Dynasty)</div>
        Shen Linsheng said: His friend, an old man, was taking a nap one summer day. In a drowsy state, he saw a woman lift the curtain and enter. She wore a white cloth around her head, dressed in mourning robes with a hemp skirt, and went into the inner chamber. He wondered if it was the neighbor's wife visiting someone in the house, but then thought, why would she enter wearing funeral clothes? As he was puzzled, the woman came out again. Upon closer inspection, she appeared to be in her thirties, her complexion sallow and swollen, with a frowning face and an intimidating demeanor. She lingered, approaching the bed. The man pretended to sleep, watching for her next move. Soon, the woman climbed onto the bed and pressed down on his abdomen, feeling as heavy as a mountain. Though his mind was clear, his hands and feet felt bound and limp. He desperately wanted to shout for help but couldn't make a sound. The woman brought her face close, sniffing around his cheeks, nose, and forehead. Her breath was cold as ice, sending a chill through his bones.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his panic, an idea came to him: when she sniffed his chin, he would bite her. Soon, she reached his chin, and the man seized the opportunity, biting her cheek with all his strength. His teeth sank into her flesh. In pain, the woman recoiled, struggling and wailing. The man bit down harder, feeling blood flow over his face, wetting the pillow. As they grappled, a voice suddenly called from outside—it was his wife, shouting that there was a ghost. The woman loosened her grip and vanished in an instant. His wife rushed in, seeing nothing, and laughed, dismissing it as a nightmare. The old man recounted the strange event and pointed out the bloodstains as proof. Upon inspection, they found blood, like water from a leaking roof, soaking the pillow and mattress. They sniffed it—it reeked of an unusual stench. The old man vomited in disgust, and for days afterward, the foul odor lingered in his mouth.
